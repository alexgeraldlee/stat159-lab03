#Stat159 Fall 2016 Lab08 - Alexander Lee

This project serves as an introduction to Shiny in R, a system which creates interactive web documents through R without having to learn or write html script. I made a basic Shiny app which takes input in the form of a dropdown menu and outputs a scatterplot of an advertising type (TV, Radio, or Newspaper) against Sales, using the `Advertising` data set provided by Gareth James, et al. in *An Introduction to Statistical Learning*.

The `Advertising.csv` dataset was downloaded from ![](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Advertising.csv).
